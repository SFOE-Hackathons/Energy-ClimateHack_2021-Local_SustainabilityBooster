The challenge: 
To achieve the goals for the swiss energy strategy we must increase sustainable energy production and consumption. There are metrics for the current status of the expansion of PV, renewable heating and e-mobility. Therefore we want to find out which are the key influencers of these sustainable indicators at the municipality level.

To identify the most important factors influencing sustainable development at the community level, we enriched the Energy Reporter (https://ory.short.gy/energiereporter) dataset with additional data (socio-demographic, weather, topographic, infrastructure, political and electricity-costs). Thus, using different statistical and machine-learning methods, we can show how the expansion of PV, sustainable heating and electric mobility depends on different socio-demographic factors, on the existing infrastructure, on the weather and on the electricity price.
